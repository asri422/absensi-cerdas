# Asset Instructions

Please add the following images to the `assets` folder:

1. **school_background.jpg** - Background image of the school building (recommended size: 800x400px)
2. **avatar_default.png** - Default avatar image for students (recommended size: 200x200px)
3. **absensi_png.png** - Logo for the attendance app (already exists)

## Temporary Solution
If you don't have these images yet, the app will still run but show placeholder images/icons.
You can add proper images later by placing them in the `assets` folder.

## Image Recommendations
- **school_background.jpg**: A photo of Miftahul Ulum Bettet building or campus
- **avatar_default.png**: A generic student avatar or profile icon
- Use PNG format for images with transparency
- Use JPG format for photos/backgrounds
